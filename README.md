## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was a great refresher for me on simple front-end concepts, nothing to fancy or complicated involved within the codebase. Just pure CSS3 at work!

### Continued development

I don't think I will be doing any more development on this project given its scope. Probably be looking into more difficult challenges in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - The absolute best educational website on front-end development techniques, and it's completely free for access!
